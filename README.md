## Quickstart

### Manual

Follow these steps to get started with this starter application.

#### Clone the repository

Go to GitHub and [clone the repository](https://github.com/deepgram-devs/text-to-speech-starter-python).

#### Install dependencies

Install the project dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Edit the config file

Copy the code from `sample.env` and create a new file called `.env`. Paste in the code and enter your API key you generated in the [Deepgram console](https://console.deepgram.com/).

```js
DEEPGRAM_API_KEY=%api_key%
```

#### Select branch

The `main` branch demonstrates a basic implementation, where text is sent to the API and an audio file response with synthesized text-to-speech is returned.

Checkout the other branches to see added functionality:

- [output streaming](https://github.com/deepgram-starters/text-to-speech-starter-python/tree/output-streaming): Demonstrates how to take advantage of Deepgram's output streaming feature. This example streams the audio response to the client as it is being generated.

```bash
git checkout output-streaming
```

#### Run the application

Once running, you can access the application in your browser at <http://127.0.0.1:5000>

python app.py
```
